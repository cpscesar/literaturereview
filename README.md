### Introduction

From Data Chaos to Clarity: Creating Your Code for Efficient Literature Review (ChatGPT-based)

The inspiration for this project came from the need to understand the current state of research on climate change. While a wealth of information is available, navigating and extracting key insights can be difficult. This code can help streamline the process, allowing you to quickly and easily access important information and make informed decisions based on the latest scientific evidence.

Specifically, I developed a Python code that allows you to efficiently 'read' as many pdf articles as you want and ask specific questions about the content of the articles. Using ChatGPT, an advanced language model, the code allows you to get answers to your questions and save them in a structured way in aÂ .csv file.
